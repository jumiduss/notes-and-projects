Database vs Database Management System

A database is an organized collection of data
    ex: MySQL, SQLite
A database management system that talks to the database for us.
    ex: PostgreSQL, Oracle Database


SQL

    SQL - Structured Query Language

        The language we used to write interactions to a database.

        Multiple relational database managers use SQL as their language.
            MySQL
            SQLite
            PostgreSQL
            Oracle
            etc...

        There do exist small differences between versions outside of the SQL standard. 
        Differences in database managers are the features offered, not the language itself. (most times)
