    How we view the data within our tables / database.
    
    SELECT column_name_1, column_name_2, ...  FROM table_name;
        SELECT explicitly specifies which data to use.
    
    SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name=value;
        WHERE pulls all rows that fit the supplied conditions.

    SELECT column_name_1 AS alias_name_1, column_name_2 AS alias_name_2, ...  FROM table_name;
        AS creates an alias for a specific search.
        This alias replaces the column name in the query result.
