C Program Structure
    Imports
    Main

Import header files:
    #include <header.h>

    Main headers to include with C programs
    <stdio.h>

Main Loop

    int main()
    {
        // Code
        return
    }

Printing a String with a Newline
    int main()
    {
        printf("String \n");
        return 0;
    }

Comments in C are two back slashes
    //

Formatting strings

    printf("Text to write %d is a integer in decimal", 123123123);
    printf("Text to write %f.1 is a float", 12312.3123); // floating point with one digit after decimal
    printf("%d",3+5); // you can also perform calculations before the format

Operators are similar to python 
*, /, +, -, %

Define a integer variable

    int a;
    a = 10

    variable type names
    int - integers
    float - 32 bit
    double - 64 bit
    
    f type names
    d - int
    f - float
    lf - double
    x - lowercase hexadecimal
    X - uppercase hexadecimal
    b - binary

    Chars can be stores as digits in any numbering system
Accept user input as a variable
    int a;
    scanf("%d", a); scanf reads a user input, the string specifies the type of input accepted

Casting Variables
    Variables keep their type cast during operations regardless of the variable the output is set to
    ex_|
    int a=5,b=2;
    double result;
    result = a/b; // result = 2.0000 because operation was performed on two int variables

    If even one of the variables was a float or double, the result would be a float/double 2.5
    You can also inline edit variable types. Continue from the example above,
    result = (double)a / b;

    You cannot convert variables to incompatible types without causing an error
        double a = 4.2981;
        int b = (int)a; - error 

Swapping
    If you have two variables, swapping the values between each variable needs to use a swap operation.

    int a=10,b=20,temp;
    // swapping a and b
    temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
