Vector: A User-Defined Sequence Type

    Vector will used for composition, not inheritance.
    We store components into an array of floats.
    
    Vector Space Model - A vector with a set of component vectors that represent information in
        an n-dimensional space.

Vector Take #1: Vector2d Compatible

    Note: When a Vector has more than 6 components, the string produced by repr() is 
        abbreviated with '...'.

    See examples.ipynb

Vector Take #2: A Sliceable Sequence

    'indices' exposes the logic implemented in the built-in sequences to handle missing or negative indices.

Vector Take #3: Dynamic Attribute Access

    super() allows us to access attributes of super-classes dynamically.

Vector Take #4: Hashing and Faster ==

    functools.reduce creates a hashable object based of a group of hashable objects.
        This is the same as using the ^ (xor) operator to the hashes of every component in succession.

    The mapping step produces one hash for each component, then a reduction aggregates all hashes with xor.
