import modules with 
    import moduleName

the module, random , makes a random number
    random.randint(minInclusiveInt,maxInclusiveInt)
    random.random() random float between 0 and 1
    random.choice(listName)
We can make our own module by making a py file in the same folder as the main file, and importing the file name at the top
