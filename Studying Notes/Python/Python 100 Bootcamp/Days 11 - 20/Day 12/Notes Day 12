Scope
    Objects and variables have a scope they fall within and it depends on the language you're writing in.
    Python's scope is based on the block you are within.

Global
    Scope available to the whole application, but must be called within a function/block
    Global variables can be referenced with global within a block
    Global constants are by convention written uppercase with underscores so 
        you know not to treat it like a variable
