How would I structure the classes for the pong game shown on screen.
    Classes: 
        Class for the paddle
        Class for the player
        Class for the score number
        Class for the Game
        Class for the ball
    Behavior:
        The player class would inherit the paddle and score classes
        The game inherits the ball, players, and displays a virtical line
        The ball detects collision with paddles, maybe within game class/main
        The game recognizes a paddle missing the ball
        The game 

How the instructor lays out the code

    Create the screen
    Create a paddle and move it
    Create a second paddle
    Create the ball and move it
    Detect collision
    Detect paddle collision
    Detect missed paddle
    Keep score
