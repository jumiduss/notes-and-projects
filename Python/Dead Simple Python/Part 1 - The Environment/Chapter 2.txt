Package - a collection of code
Virtual Environment - sandbox for python packages needed for specific projects.

    Creating a venv - conda create projEnv
    Starting a venv - conda activate projEnv

Package Manger - pip
    !!!!!!!!!!!DON'T USE SUDO ON PIP!!!!!!!!!!
        instead, install to local user directory.
    System Wide Packages:
        python3 -m pip "command"

    Environment Packages:
        pip install "command"
    
    Special Package Instructions:
        pip install "PySide6>=6.1.2" since > or < mean something in unix systems, string literals are required.
    
    Upgrading Packages:
        pip install --upgrade PySide6

        or if you have requirements:
            pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
    
    Removing Packages:
        pip uninstall "package"

    Find Packages:
        pip search web scraping

Packages and a Version Control Service (VCS)
    VCS example - Git

    Create virtual environments outside of your VCS scope
    or 
    untrack the environment directory

    If using git
        create a file in the root directory
            .gitignore 
        write code within:
            venv/
    

File Encoding
    Default is utf-8 since python 3.1

    Specify a different encoding with:
        # coding: latin-1
    or
        # This Python file uses the following encoding: latin-1
    

Using Environment Without Activating
    venv/bin/pip install pylint
    venv/bin/python

    import pylint

Other Useful Package Managers for Python
    Pipenv
    pip-tools
    poetry

Official Styling Guide
    PEP 8

Static Analyzers
    Looks for code errors before running.
    Ex. Pylint
    Ex. Flake8
        includes: PyFlakes, pycodestyle,mccabe
    Ex. Mypy - for type annotations

Auto Formatting Tools
    autopep8 - fixes whitespace, and more!
    Black - forces strict PEP 8 standard

Python Interpreters
    IDLE - comes with python
    Emacs/Vim - old school editors
    Pycharm - Most popular
    VS Code - Second most popular
    Sublime Text - very customizable
    Spyder - Matlab adjacent editor
    Eclipse + PyDev /LiClipse+
    Eric Python IDE - oldest
