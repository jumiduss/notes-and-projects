Input variables within function def parenthesis to pass in.

Position vs Keyword
    Position Arguments are based on the tuple position when passed to the function
    Keyword Arguments define the variable within the function call which decreases conflicts in code
        due to the coder's disorganization, nothing logically changes in the calls
