Dictionary
    Runs off of a key and value
    {
        "key1":"Value1",
        "key2":"Value2",
    }

    Index a dictionary by giving the key, and it returns the value
    Dictionaries will return the first matching entry
    Keys have to be a valid data type like an int or string
    Add a dictionary definition
        dictionary_name["key_name"] = "key_value"
    Looping through dictionaries 
        for term in dictionary_name:
            print(term) # The key
            print(dictionary_name[term]) # The value
    You can add more entries into a dictionary just by referencing a new key value pair
