Class Inheritance
    To allow another class to inherit attributes and methods from another,
        1. Import the first class into the second
            class class2name(class1name): 
        2. In the new class''s init, initialize the first, and import it''s variables
            def __init__(self):
                super().__init__
        3. Import any methods wanted and build off existing
            def method_name(self):
                super().method_name()
